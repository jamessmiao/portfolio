        <h2>About James Miao</h2>
        <p>I'm an fashion retailer before,and run jeans and european designer lingerie shop in china last 20 years.these ten years,the rental for shops move higher and higher,It's very hard to run a shop for small brands in most of big cities. So I'v a dream to built an online platform for exellent and small designer brans,such us LYST, Spingshop or farfetch.but It's very hard for me to get it,as I did not find the right partner to join in . There is a huge gap in design,tech and business,especialy in china.everone want fast fast and fast,everone have a plan to become next alibaba. It's the fact,I don't like it.
        </p>
        <p>I meet treehouse,and I deside to learn code and design, maybe find right smart guys to join in this plan.sorry my english is not very well.and thanks for the treehouse exellent courses.
